# blurred-landing-page
A cool landing page with blur effect.
Try it [here](https://firespindash.github.io/blurred-landing-page/). 

It's based from a video from Traversy Media.

If you can, I recommend that you create a local server and put this landing page into the server to use it as a startpage for your browser.
